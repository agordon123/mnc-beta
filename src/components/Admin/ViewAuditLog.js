/*Breif: Defines a React component named ViewAuditLog.
 It imports various components and functions from different libraries such as React, firebase/firestore, and @mui/material. 
 The component returns a button that has an onClick handler named handleClick. 
 However, the handleClick function is currently empty, and there is no implementation provided for displaying Firestore data in a table. 
 The component also uses the useNavigate hook from react-router-dom to enable navigation to other routes within the application.
