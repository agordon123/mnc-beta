/*Breif: Imports two modules, React and Route from the react and react-router-dom libraries respectively.

Defines a functional component called AppRoutes that takes a single prop children and does nothing with it. 
This component appears to be intended to be used as a wrapper around other components that should only be rendered 
if a particular route is matched by the Route component.

Exports an object that has a property called AppRoutes which refers to the previously defined AppRoutes component.*/
