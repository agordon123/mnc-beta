    <!--When a web browser loads a page, it looks for this tag to find the location of the favicon, and uses it to 
    display the favicon in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and other places. By including this tag, 
    you can ensure that your website's favicon is consistently displayed across all pages and in all browsers, 
    improving the website's visual identity and user experience.-->


    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <!--used to control the layout and scaling of a web page on different devices, such as smartphones and tablets. 
    The content attribute contains several values that specify the viewport properties.
    width=device-width sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen.
    initial-scale=1 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded to 100%.
    By including this tag in the head of a web page, you can ensure that the page is optimized for different 
    devices and screen sizes, and that users will have a consistent and usable experience regardless of the 
    device they are using to access the page. This is especially important for responsive web design, where 
    the same HTML and CSS code is used to display a page on multiple devices and screen sizes, but the layout 
    and scaling must be adapted to each device.-->

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
